### What is bot for?
   - Create Accounts
   - Farm Points
   - Check Points
   - Approve Emails without access to it (no need imap, etc)

> You can put as many proxies as u can, bot uses database and will load up proxies from extra ones


To hang several connections on 1 account, you just need to duplicate it in the accounts.txt.

## Quick Start üìö
   1. To install libraries on Windows click on `INSTALL.bat` (or in console: `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   2. To start bot use `START.bat` (or in console: `python main.py`).

### Options üìß

1. CREATE ACCOUNTS:
 - In `data/config.py` put `REGISTER_ACCOUNT_ONLY = True`
 - Throw the api key into `data/config.py`. Since there is a captcha there, you need a service for solving captchas - [AntiCaptcha](http://getcaptchasolution.com/t8yfysqmh3) or [Twocaptcha](https://2captcha.com/?from=12939391).
 - Provide emails and passwords (OPTIONAL) and proxies to register accounts as below!

2. FARM POINTS:
 - in `data/config.py` put `REGISTER_ACCOUNT_ONLY = False`
 - Provide emails and passwords and proxies to register accounts as shown below!

3. APPROVE EMAILS:
 - in `data/config.py`:
   - `APPROVE_EMAIL = True` approve email (NEEDED IMAP AND ACCESS TO EMAIL)
   - `CONNECT_WALLET = True` connect wallet (put private keys in wallets.txt)
   - `SEND_WALLET_APPROVE_LINK_TO_EMAIL = True`  # send approve link to email
   - `APPROVE_WALLET_ON_EMAIL = True`  # get approve link from email (NEEDED IMAP AND ACCESS TO EMAIL)
 - Provide emails and passwords and imap password (access to email) in format email:password:imap_password!
 - Need IMAP access to email
 -  `SEMI_AUTOMATIC_APPROVE_LINK = False `  # If True, allows manual pasting of the approval link from the email to the CLI. All flags above need to be set to True. If you use this flag, you do not need to provide IMAP access
 -  `SINGLE_IMAP_ACCOUNT = False `  # if you have possibility to forward all approve mails to single IMAP address. Usage: change False to "name@domain.com:password" of your main IMAP address
 -  `EMAIL_FOLDER = "" `  # skip for auto, folder where mails comes
 -  `IMAP_DOMAIN = "" `  # skip for auto domain, not always works

## Extra guide from user 

### 1. Setting Up Data Files

**accounts.txt** ‚Äî Format for entries is: `email:password:password`

Example: `enjoyer@gmail.com:qwert123:qwert123`  
The first password is for logging into the Grass service, and the second one is for the email.  
If you have a batch of emails with the same password, use the same password twice.

**wallets.txt** ‚Äî Enter Solana private keys in Base58 format:

A generator can be found at this link: [Create Solana Wallet](https://ct.app/createWallet/sol).

**proxies.txt** ‚Äî Use HTTP proxies in the format `login:pass@ip:port`.
